# Source: eoapi/templates/pgstacbootstrap/job.yaml
# This job initializes the PostgreSQL database with the necessary schema and data.
# Instead of using an initContainer in the deployment to wait for this job to complete,
# we use Helm hooks to control the execution order:
# 
# 1. The "post-install,post-upgrade" hook ensures this job runs after the postgres 
#    dependency is installed but before other resources (like deployments)
# 2. The "-5" hook-weight ensures this job runs after its ConfigMaps (weight -6)
# 3. The "before-hook-creation,hook-succeeded" delete policy ensures the job is recreated
#    on each helm install/upgrade and is cleaned up after successful completion
#
# DEBUGGING NOTES:
# If the job fails with "BackoffLimitExceeded" error:
# 1. Check database connectivity - ensure the database is running and accessible
# 2. Check database credentials - make sure POSTGRES_HOST, POSTGRES_PORT, etc. are correct
# 3. Check for pgstac migration errors - examine container logs for migration failures
# 4. Verify database initialization - ensure postgres extensions and roles are created
#
# The CI workflow has been enhanced with a debug step that captures comprehensive logs 
# from all pgstac-migrate pods to help diagnose failures during testing.
