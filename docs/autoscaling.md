## Autoscaling

Autoscaling is both art and science. To test out your application's autoscaling requirements you often need to consider
your data volume, data usage patterns, bottlenecks (such as the database) among many, many other things.

Load testing, metrics and observability will help you explore what those autoscaling needs are. This `eoapi-k8s` chart
includes some default autoscaling values as well as an `eoapi-support` chart to help you do this exploration. Below
we walk through how to set these things up.

---

### Verify `metrics-server` is installed by default in EKS or GCP

Newer versions of AWS EKS and GCP GKE "should" come with `metrics-server` (the default k8s metrics utility) pre-installed
in the `kube-system` namespace. You can verify this using:


   ```sh
   kubectl get deployment metrics-server -n kube-system
   ```

If it's not there then you can install it with default configuration by doing:

   ```sh
   helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
   helm repo update
   helm -n kube-system install metrics-server bitnami/metrics-server
   # helm -n kube-system delete metrics-server
   ```
After installing verify things are working by getting nodes stats:

   ```sh
   kubectl get --raw /apis/metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/nodes | jq '.items[] | {name:.metadata.name, cpu:.usage.cpu, memory:.usage.memory}'
   ```

---

### Review [Default Configuration and Options](configuration.md)

[This document](configuration.md) will explain the differences in the `autoscaling` block for each service:

   ```yaml
   autoscaling:
       enabled: false
       minReplicas: 1
       maxReplicas: 10
       # `type`: "cpu" || "requestRate" || "both"
       type: "requestRate"
       behaviour: {}
         scaleDown:
           stabilizationWindowSeconds: 60
         scaleUp:
           stabilizationWindowSeconds: 0
       targets:
         # matches `type` value above unless `type: "both"` is selected
         cpu: 85
         requestRate: 15000
   ```

---

### Review [Production Storage](aws-gpc-storage-walkthrough.md) Set Up

The default `eoapi` helm chart installs an in-memory postgres/postgis database but most folks will want to
test autoscaling against something more production suitable

---

### Install `eoapi-support` Chart

This chart has the metrics, observability and visualization dependencies

1. change into this repository's `/helm-chart/` folder

2. then download the dependencies for the `eoapi-support` chart

   ```sh
   helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
   helm dependency build ./eoapi-support
   ```

3. then install those dependencies:

   ```sh
   helm upgrade --install \
     --namespace eoapi \
     --create-namespace \
     eoapi-support \
     ./eoapi-support
   # if you need to delete the chart you can run:
   # helm delete eoapi-support  -n eoapi
   ```
   
4. verify that everything is set up correctly and no deployments are failing:

   ```sh
   watch -n 1 "kubectl -n eoapi get pod,svc"
   # NAME                                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   # pod/eoapi-support-grafana-7fdc9688dd-wkw7p              1/1     Running   0          79s
   # pod/eoapi-support-kube-state-metrics-54d75784db-ghgbd   1/1     Running   0          79s
   # pod/eoapi-support-prometheus-adapter-668b6bd89c-kb25q   1/1     Running   0          79s
   # pod/eoapi-support-prometheus-node-exporter-6f96z        1/1     Running   0          79s
   # pod/eoapi-support-prometheus-node-exporter-fr96x        1/1     Running   0          79s
   # pod/eoapi-support-prometheus-node-exporter-pdvvp        1/1     Running   0          79s
   # pod/eoapi-support-prometheus-server-76dcfc684b-wmk5c    2/2     Running   0          79s

   # NAME                                             TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)        AGE
   # service/eoapi-support-grafana                    LoadBalancer   10.123.248.75    104.154.59.180   80:30821/TCP   79s
   # service/eoapi-support-kube-state-metrics         ClusterIP      10.123.241.247   <none>           8080/TCP       79s
   # service/eoapi-support-prometheus-adapter         ClusterIP      10.123.249.21    <none>           443/TCP        79s
   # service/eoapi-support-prometheus-node-exporter   ClusterIP      10.123.249.90    <none>           9100/TCP       79s
   # service/eoapi-support-prometheus-server          ClusterIP      10.123.247.255   <none>           80/TCP         79s 
   ```

5. note that the `service/eoapi-support-grafana` has an EXTERNAL-IP that we can use to view it. This is just a quick way to work with it. You'll want to set it up with a ingress in the future

6. to log into Grafana you'll need to export the default username/password it came installed with:

   ```sh
   kubectl get secret eoapi-support-grafana --template='{{index .data "admin-user"}}' -n eoapi | base64 -d
     # <not-showing-output>
   kubectl get secret eoapi-support-grafana --template='{{index .data "admin-password"}}' -n eoapi | base64 -d
     # <not-showing-output>
   ```

### Install Newest `eoapi` Chart

1. The `autoscaling` key was added to the `values.yaml` in version in chart version `0.1.11`. So update your eoapi repo:

   ```sh
   helm repo add eoapi https://devseed.com/eoapi-k8s/
   helm repo update
   ```

2. Add the required secret overrides and autoscaling changes you need to an arbitrarily named `.yaml` file (`config.yaml` below) 
but the important part here is that we are enabling `autoscaling` and playing with `requestRate` metric

   ```sh
   cat config.yaml 
   ```
   
   ```yaml
   ingress:
     enabled: true
     className: "nginx"
   db:
     enabled: true
     settings:
       resources:
         requests:
           storage: "100Mi"
           cpu: "256m"
           memory: "1024Mi"
         limits:
           cpu: "512m"
           memory: "1024Mi"
       secrets:
         PGUSER: "username"
         POSTGRES_USER: "username"
         PGPASSWORD: "password"
         POSTGRES_PASSWORD: "password"
   raster:
     enabled: true
     autoscaling:
       enabled: true
       type: "requestRate"
       targets:
         requestRate: 50
     settings:
       resources:
         limits:
           cpu: "768m"
           memory: "4096Mi"
         requests:
           cpu: "256m"
           memory: "1024Mi"
   stac:
     enabled: true
     autoscaling:
       enabled: true
       type: "requestRate"
       targets:
         requestRate: 50
     settings:
       resources:
         limits:
           cpu: "1280m"
           memory: "1536Mi"
         requests:
           cpu: "512m"
           memory: "1024Mi"
   vector:
     enabled: true
     autoscaling:
       enabled: true
       type: "requestRate"
       targets:
         requestRate: 50
     settings:
       resources:
         limits:
           cpu: "768m"
           memory: "1536Mi"
         requests:
           cpu: "256m"
           memory: "1024Mi"
   ```

3. Then `helm install` the eoapi chart pointing to the path for the `config.yaml` above

   ```sh
   helm upgrade --install -n eoapi --create-namespace eoapi eoapi/eoapi --version 0.1.11 -f config.yaml
   # if you need to delete the chart then you can run: 
   # helm delete eoapi -n eoapi
   ```

4. Make sure all pods and services are in `STATUS=Running`:

   ```sh
   kubectl -n eoapi get pods,service
     #  NAME                                                    READY   STATUS              RESTARTS      AGE

### Enable a Prometheus to Scrape Nginx

1. Now we need to tell the nginx ingress controller that it should allow prometheus to scrape it. This is a requirement to get our custom metrics. 

2. Get the values that `ingress-nginx` was deployed with so we can append our rules to them. (If you followed the cloud provider set up docs for [EKS](aws-eks.md) or [GKE](gcp-gke.md) then these configuration values should already be set ). Oftentimes this resource is in `ingress-nginx` namespace

   ```sh
   # this assumes your release name is `ingress-nginx`, though you might've named it something else
   helm get values ingress-nginx -n ingress-nginx
     
   # USER-SUPPLIED VALUES:
   # If it is empty, this indicates that nothing has been applied, or no custom values were previously set.
   ```

3. Create an empty `config_ingress.yaml` somewhere on your file system. Take everything from below `USER-SUPPLIED VALUES:` and make `ingress-nginx` scrapable

   ```yaml
     controller:
       enableLatencyMetrics: true
       metrics:
         enabled: true
         service:
           annotations:
             prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
             prometheus.io/port: "10254"
   ```
   
4. Redeploy your `ingress-nginx` release with the configuration from the last step:

   ```sh
   # this assumes your release name is `ingress-nginx` and that the repo was installed as `ingress-nginx` 
   # though you might've named them something else
   helm -n ingress-nginx upgrade ingress-nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx -f config_ingress.yaml
   ```

5. Now go back to Grafana and hit the refresh button and wait a bit. You should see data in your graphs

---

### Add a `nip.io` Host to Your Ingress

1. Nginx will not expose metrics for ingresses without hosts or with wildcards. Since `eoapi-k8s` doesn't set up
hosts for you then you'll need to find the `EXTERNAL-IP` for your `ingress-nginx-controller` and use that
to set up a simple host

2. Find the IP that your `ingress-nginx-controller` exposes:

   ```sh
   kubectl -n ingress-nginx get svc/ingress-nginx-controller -o=jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}'
     35.239.254.21%
   ```
   
3. Then live edit your shared ingress for eoapi services to build an arbitrary host name using `nip.io`. Since
one of the Grafana default charts filters on hostname it's probably best to keep the format to `eoapi-<your-external-ip-address-from-last-step>.nip.io`.
`nip.io` will proxy traffic with a full domain to your instance. Using `nip.io` isn't long-term solution but a way to test:

   ```sh
   kubectl edit ingress nginx-service-ingress-shared-eoapi -n eoapi

   ## In case if eks, replace the elb url without using nip.io
   kubectl -n ingress-nginx  get svc/ingress-nginx-controller -o=jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}'
   ```
   
   ```yaml
   # BEFORE
   spec:
   ingressClassName: nginx
   rules:
   - http:
       paths:
       ...
   ```

   ```yaml
   # AFTER
   spec:
   ingressClassName: nginx
   rules:
   - host: eoapi-35.239.254.92.nip.io
     http:
       paths:
       ...
   ```

And then finally roll out the deployment.

   ```sh
   kubectl rollout restart deploy/ingress-nginx-controller -n ingress-nginx

   ```

### Now move onto the [Load Testing](loaadtesting.md) document
